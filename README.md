# Project Structure



TBD:
* Implement in the classroom.
* Create 2 versions: A user and a developer one. The user version would be what we already have and the developer one we could take pictures of a target, create the circuit and then share with all the users.
* Make a PCB version: single-layer, dual-layer and multi-layer. Would be
useful to check the size of designed PCB.
* Improve the visual presentation and implement more tutorials.
* Fix bugs.
* Market it :)
