The navigation between scenes is made using a combination of buttons on the screan and the android navigation buttons.

The beginning of the tutorial is made by the detection of a marker in an automatic way.

## TBD:
* Implement in the classroom;
* Create 2 versions: A user and a developer one. The user version would be what we already have and the developer one we could take pictures of a target, create the circuit and then share with all the users;
* Make a PCB version: single-layer, dual-layer and multi-layer. Would be useful to check the size of designed PCB;
* Improve the visual presentation and implement more tutorials;
* Fix bugs;
* Market it. :)
